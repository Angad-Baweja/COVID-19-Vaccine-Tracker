The project involved the development of a sophisticated COVID-19 vaccine tracker, which aimed to provide comprehensive information on global vaccination efforts. To achieve this, data was extracted from a reliable online source, "Our World in Data" (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations), which serves as a reputable repository of COVID-19 vaccination data.
The extracted data underwent a rigorous cleaning and processing phase, leveraging SQL to manipulate and transform the data into a suitable format for analysis. This ensured the accuracy and consistency of the dataset, allowing for reliable insights to be derived.
Following the data processing phase, the transformed data was exported into a CSV file. This facilitated the seamless integration of the data into other analytical tools and platforms.
To visualize and present the data effectively, the Tableau software was employed. Through the utilization of Tableau, I was able to develop a diverse range of compelling visualizations, including charts, graphs, and maps, to effectively convey the intricate patterns and trends in COVID-19 vaccination data.
Moreover, key performance indicators (KPIs) were meticulously defined and calculated based on the processed dataset. KPIs provide a quantitative measure of the progress and effectiveness of vaccination campaigns, allowing stakeholders to assess the impact and success of their efforts.
The culmination of this endeavor resulted in the creation of a comprehensive and visually appealing dashboard. This dashboard consolidated the various visualizations and KPIs, providing a centralized hub for users to explore, analyze, and gain insights from the COVID-19 vaccination data.
